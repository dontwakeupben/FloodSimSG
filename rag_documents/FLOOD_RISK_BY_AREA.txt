FLOOD RISK BY AREA
Singapore Flood-Prone Locations and Risk Assessment

=== Methodology ===
PUB classifies flood risk using a combination of:
- Historical flood incidence data (post-2000)
- Terrain elevation analysis (LiDAR mapping)
- Drainage capacity modeling
- Land use changes and urban development
- Climate change projections (increasing rainfall intensity)

Risk categories:
- High Risk: Flooded multiple times in past decade, significant property damage potential
- Medium Risk: Occasional flash floods, mainly road-level inundation
- Low Risk: Rare flooding, quick dissipation, minor inconvenience

=== High-Risk Zones ===

Orchard Road Area:
- Tanglin Mall/Tanglin Carpark (Basement level, flooded 2010/2011)
- Orchard Road intersections with Scotts Road/Paterson Road
- Liat Towers basement (flooded 2010)
- Far East Shopping Centre vicinity
Risk factors: Low-lying topography, intense commercial development, limited drainage capacity in older sections

Bukit Timah Area:
- Bukit Timah Road (between Sixth Avenue and Woodcut Road)
- Clementi Road near Ngee Ann Polytechnic
- Dunearn Road underpasses
Risk factors: Natural valley topography, upstream catchment from Central Catchment Nature Reserve

Northern Areas:
- Admiralty Road West (industrial estates)
- Woodlands Avenue 12
- Yishun Avenue 5/Ring Road
Risk factors: Older drainage infrastructure, industrial runoff, flat terrain

Eastern Industrial:
- Paya Lebar Road/Airport Road
- Tampines Avenue 10 industrial area
- Changi Business Park (low-lying sections)
Risk factors: High runoff from concrete surfaces, tidal influences

=== Medium-Risk Zones ===

Central Business District:
- Robinson Road (occasional flash floods)
- Shenton Way basements
- Cecil Street
Risk factors: Dense development, but modern drainage infrastructure

Western Regions:
- Jurong West Avenue 1
- Pioneer Road junctions
- Tuas industrial areas (increasing risk with development)
Risk factors: Reclaimed land, ongoing construction, sediment runoff

=== Game-Specific Locations Profile ===

ION Orchard (Low Risk):
- Elevation: 18m above sea level
- Flood risk: Minimal due to high elevation
- Vulnerability: Underground MRT connection (ION Station) subject to standard MRT protocols
- Historical data: No flooding incidents since opening in 2009

Orchard Road (High Risk):
- Elevation: 10-12m varying along stretch
- Flood risk: Flash flooding during intense thunderstorms (>50mm/hour)
- Vulnerable points: Intersections, basement carparks, underground pedestrian crossings
- Historical data: Major floods 2010, 2011, 2017, 2023

Tanglin Carpark (Critical Risk):
- Elevation: 8m (basement level effectively 3-4m below road)
- Flood risk: Severe basement flooding within 30 minutes of heavy rain
- Historical data: Completely submerged December 2010 and January 2011
- Current status: Improved drainage pumps installed, but remains high-risk

=== Warning Thresholds ===
PUB issues flood warnings when:
- Water level reaches 90% of drain capacity
- Rainfall exceeds 50mm/hour in high-risk zones
- Tide levels coincide with heavy rain (compound flooding risk)

=== Real-Time Monitoring ===
Access current flood status:
- PUB MyWaters app (iOS/Android)
- Public Utilities Board website flood map
- LTA OneMotoring road closure updates
- Radio broadcast during severe weather
