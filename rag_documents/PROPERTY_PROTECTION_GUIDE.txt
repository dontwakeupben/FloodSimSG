PROPERTY PROTECTION GUIDE
Home and Business Flood Mitigation Strategies

=== Risk Assessment for Properties ===

Determining Your Risk Level:
- Check PUB's flood map (www.pub.gov.sg/floodmap) by postal code
- Ground floor and basement units highest risk
- Properties built before 1990 may lack modern drainage connections
- Proximity to canals, rivers, or low-lying roads increases risk
- Construction upstream can alter drainage patterns

Flood-Prone Property Types in Singapore:
- Basement carparks (Tanglin Mall model)
- Ground-floor shop houses (Katong, Geylang, Chinatown)
- Bungalows with sunken courtyards or pools
- Industrial units in Pioneer, Tuas (ponding areas)
- Retail units in flood-prone malls (historical Orchard Road properties)

=== Protecting Homes from Floods ===

Structural Modifications:
- Raise electrical outlets and switches minimum 30cm above floor level
- Install backflow prevention valves on toilets and drains (prevents sewage backup)
- Waterproof external walls with sealant (silicone-based for concrete)
- Raise air-conditioning compressor units above potential flood level
- Install sump pumps with battery backup in basements

Entry Point Protection:
- Doorway flood barriers (aluminum or PVC, sandbag alternatives)
- Waterproof seals for garage doors
- Raise entrance thresholds by 15cm where possible
- Install flood skirts around air vents

Landscaping Solutions:
- Create berms (raised earth barriers) around property perimeter
- Install permeable pavers instead of concrete for driveways
- Plant rain gardens to absorb runoff (select flood-tolerant species)
- Ensure downspouts direct water 2m away from foundation

=== Sandbag Deployment ===

Proper Technique:
- Fill sandbags 1/2 to 2/3 full (overfilled bags don't seal well)
- Lay bags like bricks - staggered joints, overlapping seams
- Tamp down each layer to eliminate gaps
- Build pyramid-style walls for stability (wider base than height)
- Place plastic sheeting under sandbag wall for better seal

Strategic Placement:
- Across doorways (inside and outside for double protection)
- Around floor drains (to prevent backup)
- Air conditioning vents (critical for HDB flats)
- Garage entrances (lowest point of most homes)

Alternatives to Traditional Sandbags:
- HydraSacks/HydraSnakes: Gel-filled, expand when wet, lightweight when dry
- Flood gates: Rigid barriers mounted in door frames
- Inflatable dams: Quick deployment for wide openings
- Water-filled tubes: Replace sand, easier to store and deploy

Sources in Singapore:
- PUB provides limited sandbags to flood-prone residents (apply via website)
- Hardware stores: Home-Fix, Selffix, Giant
- Online: Lazada, Shopee (search "flood barriers")
- Construction suppliers for bulk orders

=== Electrical Safety ===

Pre-Flood Preparation:
- Identify main circuit breaker location (know how to shut off quickly)
- Move electronics to upper floors or raise on blocks
- Unplug all non-essential appliances during heavy rain warnings
- Backup power: Consider portable generators for critical medical equipment (use outdoors only)

During Flooding:
- Turn off main power if water enters home (do not walk through water to do so)
- Never touch electrical equipment if wet or standing in water
- If wires fall into standing water, evacuate immediately
- Avoid using landline phones during thunderstorms (lightning risk via lines)

Post-Flood Restoration:
- Have licensed electrician inspect system before restoring power
- Replace all electrical outlets that were submerged
- Discard appliances that were underwater (fire hazard)
- Check for gas leaks if LPG used (pilot lights may extinguish)

=== Insurance Coverage ===

Types of Coverage:
- Home Contents Insurance: Covers personal belongings (furniture, electronics)
- Building Insurance: Covers structure (for private property owners)
- Fire Insurance (HDB): Mandatory but limited coverage, usually excludes flood
- Comprehensive Home Insurance: Includes flood, theft, accidental damage

Flood-Specific Clauses:
- Check "Acts of God" or "Natural Disasters" sections
- Note exclusions for gradual seepage vs. sudden flooding
- Understand deductible amounts (excess)
- Confirm coverage for alternative accommodation during repairs

Documentation for Claims:
- Photograph/video property condition before monsoon season
- Keep receipts for high-value items (scanned copies in cloud)
- Document flood damage immediately (date-stamped photos)
- Obtain police reports for major flooding events
- Keep records of all mitigation expenses (sandbags, pumps, etc.)

Claim Process:
1. Notify insurer within 24 hours (most require immediate reporting)
2. Prevent further damage (mitigation duty)
3. Inventory damaged items (model numbers, purchase dates)
4. Obtain repair quotes from approved contractors
5. Cooperate with loss adjusters inspection

Common Exclusions:
- Damage from lack of maintenance (blocked drains on property)
- Unoccupied properties (>30 days empty)
- Basement contents unless specifically declared
- Construction materials (if renovating during flood)

=== Business Continuity ===

For Retail/Commercial Tenants:
- Inventory management: Raise stock 15cm minimum during monsoon
- Electronic point-of-sale systems: Portable, can move to safety
- Document storage: Cloud-based, waterproof safes for originals
- Business interruption insurance: Covers lost income during closure

For Offices:
- Server rooms: Locate above ground floor, waterproof raised flooring
- Work-from-home protocols: Activated when flood warnings issued
- Critical documents: Waterproof fire safes, offsite backups
- Client communication: Automated systems to notify of closure

Supply Chain Considerations:
- Identify alternative suppliers outside flood zones
- 72-hour inventory buffer for critical stock
- Waterproof packaging for stored goods
- Delivery route planning avoiding flood-prone roads

=== Emergency Kits for Properties ===

Home Emergency Kit:
- Portable radio (battery or hand-crank)
- First aid kit (waterproof container)
- Torches and extra batteries
- Important documents (waterproof bag): IC, passports, insurance policies, property deeds
- Medications (7-day supply)
- Bottled water (4 liters per person per day)
- Non-perishable food (3-day supply)
- Cash (ATMs may be down)
- Whistle (to signal for help)

Business Emergency Kit:
- Contact lists (employees, suppliers, customers)
- Backup drives with critical data
- Emergency signage (closure notices)
- Cleaning supplies (mops, buckets, disinfectant)
- Wet/dry vacuum (shop vac for water removal)
- Dehumidifiers (prevent mold growth)

=== Recovery and Remediation ===

Immediate Actions (First 24 Hours):
- Document everything (photos for insurance)
- Remove water quickly (mold grows within 48 hours)
- Salvage valuables (prioritize documents, electronics)
- Contact insurance company
- Notify landlord if tenant

Drying Out Process:
- Industrial fans and dehumidifiers (rent from Home-Fix or similar)
- Remove wet carpets and underlay (usually cannot be saved)
- Cut drywall 15cm above water line (prevents wicking)
- Dispose of contaminated insulation
- Clean all hard surfaces with bleach solution (1:10 ratio)

Mold Prevention:
- Keep humidity below 60%
- Run air conditioning continuously initially
- Inspect behind walls and under floors
- Professional mold assessment if musty odors persist
- Health symptoms (respiratory) indicate hidden mold

Long-Term Recovery:
- Structural assessment by professional engineer
- Electrical system certification
- Pest control (flood displaces rodents and insects)
- Landscape restoration (prevent erosion)
- Update emergency plans based on lessons learned
