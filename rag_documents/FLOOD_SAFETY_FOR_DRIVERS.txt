FLOOD SAFETY FOR DRIVERS
Vehicle Protection and Survival During Flooding

=== The Golden Rule ===
Never drive through flooded roads. As little as 15cm (6 inches) of water can cause loss of control in most vehicles, and 30cm (1 foot) can float a car. Floodwater may hide washed-out roads, debris, or open manholes. If you encounter a flooded road, turn around and find an alternative route.

=== Risk Assessment Before Driving ===

Pre-Trip Checks:
- Check PUB MyWaters app for flood alerts
- Check LTA OneMotoring for road closures
- Listen to radio traffic updates (93.8FM, 95.8FM)
- Avoid basement carparks in flood-prone areas during heavy rain warnings

Visual Cues of Danger:
- Water reaching curb level or higher
- Other vehicles stalled in water ahead
- Debris floating on road surface
- Water moving rapidly (even shallow fast water can sweep vehicles away)
- Downed power lines (electrocution risk)

=== If You Must Drive (Heavy Rain) ===

Safe Driving Techniques:
- Reduce speed by 30-50% to prevent hydroplaning
- Maintain 4-second following distance (double normal)
- Use low beam headlights (high beams reflect off rain)
- Avoid sudden braking; pump brakes gently if no ABS
- Stay in middle lanes (roads crown in center, less pooling)

Hazard Zones to Avoid:
- Underpasses and tunnels (flood first, drain last)
- Basements of shopping centers (Tanglin Mall, Liat Towers history)
- Low-lying HDB carparks (ground level)
- Construction zones (sediment and debris block drains)
- Road sections adjacent to canals (overflow points)

=== Vehicle Stalls in Flood - Survival Protocol ===

Immediate Actions (Water Below Door Level):
1. Do not restart engine (hydrolock damage)
2. Turn on hazard lights
3. Call for assistance (tow truck, 1800-2255-582 LTA)
4. Stay in vehicle if water is moving or rising slowly

Emergency Evacuation (Water Rising Above Door Level):
1. Unbuckle seatbelts immediately
2. Unlock all doors (electric locks may fail)
3. Open windows before water reaches halfway (pressure makes opening doors impossible)
4. If windows won't open: Use center punch, heavy object, or headrest metal prongs to break side windows (front/rear windshields are tempered glass, harder to break)
5. Exit through windows, climb to roof
6. Call 995 (SCDF) for rescue
7. Stay on roof until water recedes or rescue arrives - do not attempt to swim

Critical Warnings:
- 15cm of water can knock a person off their feet if moving
- 60cm of water can carry away most SUVs
- Water can hide 3-meter deep drains or sinkholes
- Exhaust pipe submersion can cause carbon monoxide backup into vehicle

=== After the Flood ===

Immediate Vehicle Assessment:
- Do not start the engine if water reached exhaust or intake levels
- Check oil dipstick for water droplets (indicates engine contamination)
- Inspect air filter for water damage
- Check all fluid levels for contamination
- Document damage with photographs for insurance

Professional Inspection Required:
- Electrical systems (ECU, sensors, wiring)
- Brake systems (water contamination reduces effectiveness)
- Transmission and differential fluids
- Interior mold and mildew treatment (health hazard)

Total Loss Indicators:
- Water reached dashboard level (electronics destroyed)
- Saltwater flooding (corrosion inevitable)
- Vehicle submerged >24 hours
- Airbag system compromised

=== Insurance Claims ===

Coverage Types:
- Comprehensive insurance: Covers flood damage (not third-party only)
- "Act of God" coverage: Standard in Singapore comprehensive policies
- Engine damage: Covered if you did not intentionally drive into flood

Claim Process:
1. Report within 24 hours (hotline or app)
2. Do not move vehicle until insurer inspects (unless safety requires)
3. Obtain police report if road flooding caused accident
4. Keep receipts for emergency towing (reimbursable)
5. Hire own assessor if dispute on write-off valuation

Common Exclusions:
- Driving through obvious flood (negligence)
- Starting engine after stalling in water
- Modified vehicles without declared modifications
- Commercial vehicles without appropriate coverage

Fraud Warning:
Intentionally driving into floods to claim insurance constitutes fraud. Insurers share data on "flood magnets" - vehicles repeatedly damaged in floods.

=== Vehicle Preparation ===

Flood-Resistant Measures:
- Know your vehicle's wading depth (check manual, usually 30-50cm for sedans, 50-70cm for SUVs)
- Install snorkel air intake for extreme conditions (off-road vehicles)
- Seal electrical components with dielectric grease
- Park on elevated ground during monsoon warnings

Emergency Kit for Monsoon Season:
- Torchlight and whistle (roof rescue signaling)
- Seatbelt cutter/window hammer (accessible from driver's seat)
- Tow rope and reflective triangles
- Portable phone charger
- Bottle of water and energy bars
- Raincoat (umbrellas useless in high winds)

=== Alternative Parking During Warnings ===

When PUB issues flood warnings for your area:
- Use elevated HDB MSCP (multi-story carpark) levels 3+
- Shopping mall rooftop carparks (ION Orchard, Ngee Ann City)
- Designated high-ground parking (check with Town Council)
- Avoid: Basement carparks in Tanglin, Orchard, Bukit Timah areas

Employer Responsibilities:
- Allow flexible hours during heavy rain warnings
- Provide alternative parking information
- Excuse lateness due to road closures (document with traffic app screenshots)

=== Legal and Safety Responsibilities ===

Motorist duties under Singapore law:
- Section 65, Road Traffic Act: Must not drive without reasonable consideration for others
- Driving through flood splash pedestrians: Fines up to $1,000 and 3 demerit points
- Ignoring road closure signs: $130 fine, possible court prosecution
- Causing wake that damages property: Civil liability

Good Samaritan Protocol:
- Only assist others if safe to do so
- Call 995 for trapped motorists rather than attempting rescue yourself
- Direct traffic around flooded areas if police not yet present
- Document incidents with photos for authorities
