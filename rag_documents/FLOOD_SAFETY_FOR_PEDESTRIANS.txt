FLOOD SAFETY FOR PEDESTRIANS
Walking Safety and Route Planning During Floods

=== General Safety Principles ===
Pedestrians are the most vulnerable during flash floods. Unlike vehicles, humans offer no protection from debris, contamination, or electrocution risks. Six inches (15cm) of fast-moving water can knock an adult off their feet, and two feet (60cm) can sweep away even strong swimmers. Singapore's urban floods present unique hazards including open manholes, submerged debris, and contaminated water from drains and sewers.

=== Avoiding Underground Crossings ===

High-Risk Locations:
- Orchard MRT underground passages (connecting ION, Ngee Ann City, Somerset)
- Bras Basah MRT area underground network
- Marina Bay underground city
- HDB estate underground linkways (especially older estates)

Warning Signs to Heed:
- Water visible at entrance steps
- Automatic barriers deployed (indicates management is aware of flood risk)
- Power outages or dimmed emergency lighting
- Unusual odors (sewage backup indication)

Safe Alternatives:
- Use overhead bridges instead of underpasses
- Wait in mall/shops until water recedes (usually 30-60 minutes)
- Surface crossings at traffic lights (higher ground)
- Taxi/Grab instead of walking (split cost with others if stranded)

=== Safe Routes During Floods ===

Route Planning Apps:
- MyWaters (PUB) shows real-time flood locations
- Google Maps indicates road closures (user-reported)
- Avoid "fastest route" during heavy rain; choose "less walking" or bus options

Elevated Routes (Orchard Area Example):
- Instead of Orchard Road level, use ION Sky (outdoor garden, 5th floor)
- Use overhead bridges with covered walkways (connect malls)
- HDB MSCP rooftops as emergency shortcuts (if familiar with area)
- MRT elevated stations as landmarks (Redhill, Tiong Bahru, etc.)

Avoid These Pathways:
- Any path alongside canals (can overflow without warning)
- Covered drains (grates can lift under pressure)
- Construction site perimeters (sediment and equipment hazards)
- Tree-lined paths (lightning and falling branch risks during storms)

=== Footwear and Clothing Advice ===

Appropriate Footwear:
- Water-resistant boots (hunter boots or similar) for known flood areas
- Avoid: Leather shoes (damage), high heels (tripping), flip-flops (slipping, debris cuts)
- Backup shoes: Keep spare dry footwear at office/in bag during monsoon

Clothing Considerations:
- Quick-dry synthetic fabrics (cotton stays wet and cold)
- Bright colors or reflective strips (visibility to drivers in poor conditions)
- Compact umbrella (large golf umbrellas dangerous in winds)
- Waterproof bag or case for electronics and documents

Health Protection:
- Long pants to prevent cuts from hidden debris
- Waterproof bandages for existing wounds (floodwater contamination)
- Insect repellent (mosquitoes breed in stagnant water within 2 days)

=== Walking in Heavy Rain ===

Visibility Measures:
- Wear bright/reflective clothing
- Carry small torchlight (underpasses get dark even during day)
- Use phone flashlight when crossing dim areas (but keep phone protected)

Hazards to Watch For:
- Manhole covers: Can be displaced by water pressure creating sinkholes
- Downed power lines: Stay 10m away, report to 1800-778-8888 (SP Group)
- Open drains: Covers may be removed by water flow or vandals
- Slippery surfaces: Marble mall entrances, metal grates, painted road markings
- Cyclists: They have poor visibility too; give them space

Group Safety:
- Walk in groups of 2+ during severe weather
- Establish meeting points if separated
- Assist elderly or disabled (offer arm, slow pace)
- Children must hold adult hands (water can sweep them away instantly)

=== Specific Location Guidance ===

Orchard Road Precautions:
- Use overhead bridge at ION/Shaun Road (elevated walkway)
- Avoid basement exits (even if shortcut is familiar)
- If caught at Tanglin Mall area, proceed to Hyatt Hotel (high ground, lobby accessible)
- Wait in Wisma Atria or Ngee Ann City (both flood-protected)

HDB Estate Navigation:
- Use covered walkways on upper floors (connecting blocks)
- Void decks may flood; use staircases to cross between blocks
- Avoid open fields (lightning risk, no shelter)
- Community centers act as emergency shelters if stranded

Business District (Raffles Place/Tanjong Pagar):
- Underground network extensive but flood-prone at entry points
- Use elevated sky bridges (OCBC Centre, UOB Plaza connections)
- Marina Bay area: Stick to MRT network or elevated Marina Bay Financial Centre walkways

=== Emergency Procedures ===

If Caught in Rising Water:
1. Move perpendicular to water flow (toward higher ground)
2. Do not attempt to swim against current (exhaustion risk)
3. Grab onto stable objects (railings, trees, fences)
4. Call 995 (SCDF) - they prioritize water rescues
5. Signal rescuers with bright clothing or phone flashlight

If Trapped in Building:
- Move to second floor or higher
- Signal for help from windows (white cloth, flashlight)
- Do not use elevators (power failure risk)
- Listen to battery radio for updates
- Conserve phone battery for emergency calls only

Medical Emergencies:
- Cuts from flood debris: Clean immediately, seek tetanus shot if deep
- Water contact with eyes: Rinse with clean water, seek medical attention (conjunctivitis risk)
- Hypothermia: Remove wet clothing, wrap in blankets even in tropical weather (wind chill effect)
- Respiratory issues: Floodwater aerosols can carry bacteria; use mask if available

=== Hygiene and Health Post-Exposure ===

Immediate Actions:
- Wash hands thoroughly with soap before eating/touching face
- Shower with antiseptic soap as soon as possible
- Wash contaminated clothing separately with hot water
- Disinfect shoes (bleach solution) to prevent mold

Disease Risks from Floodwater:
- Leptospirosis (rat urine): Symptoms 3-10 days later (fever, muscle pain)
- Dengue fever: Mosquitoes breed in stagnant water
- Conjunctivitis: Eye infections from contaminated water
- Skin infections: Cuts exposed to bacteria

When to Seek Medical Attention:
- Fever within 10 days of flood exposure
- Persistent diarrhea or vomiting
- Skin rashes or infected cuts
- Respiratory difficulties

=== Community Support ===

Assisting Neighbors:
- Check on elderly living alone (especially ground floor units)
- Help move valuables to higher shelves if time permits
- Share information about road conditions and shelter locations
- Offer dry clothing and hot drinks to stranded individuals

Reporting Hazards:
- Open manholes/damaged drains: PUB 1800-CALL-PUB
- Fallen trees: NParks 1800-471-7300
- Power lines down: SP Group 1800-778-8888
- General emergencies: 999 (Police) or 995 (SCDF)

- Police: 999
- PUB (Drainage/Flooding): 1800-CALL-PUB
- NEA (Public Health): 1800-2255-632
