SINGAPORE FLOOD SAFETY BASICS

Singapore's Climate and Flood Risk
----------------------------------
Singapore has a tropical climate with high rainfall throughout the year. The monsoon seasons (November to January and June to September) bring particularly heavy rain. While Singapore has excellent drainage infrastructure, localized flooding can still occur during intense downpours.

Understanding Flood Warnings
----------------------------
PUB (Public Utilities Board) issues flood warnings through various channels:
- PUB's Facebook and Twitter (@PUBsingapore)
- MyENV app
- Radio and TV broadcasts
- SMS alerts for affected areas

Flood warning levels:
- Advisory: Light flooding possible, monitor conditions
- Warning: Flooding likely, avoid affected areas
- Critical: Severe flooding, evacuate if instructed

Safety During Floods
--------------------
If you are caught in a flood:

1. Move to Higher Ground Immediately
   - Go to the highest floor of your building
   - Avoid basements and underground areas
   - Do not use elevators

2. Never Walk Through Flowing Water
   - Just 6 inches of moving water can knock you down
   - 12 inches can carry away most cars
   - Water may hide dangers like open drains or debris

3. Avoid Driving Through Flood Water
   - Turn around, don't drown
   - Most flood deaths occur in vehicles
   - Water depth is hard to judge

4. Stay Away from Power Lines
   - Water conducts electricity
   - Report downed lines to SP Group (1800-778-8888)

5. Listen to Official Instructions
   - Follow evacuation orders promptly
   - Contact emergency services if trapped

Historical Context: Tanglin Mall Floods
---------------------------------------
In 2010 and 2011, Tanglin Mall's basement carpark experienced severe flooding during heavy rainfall. These incidents highlighted the vulnerability of underground spaces during intense storms and led to improved drainage systems in the area.

Flood-Prone Areas in Singapore
------------------------------
While flooding is rare due to Singapore's extensive drainage network, historically flood-prone areas include:
- Low-lying areas in the city center
- Basement carparks
- Areas near construction sites
- Regions with aging drainage infrastructure

Preparation Tips
----------------
- Keep emergency kit ready (flashlight, radio, first aid)
- Know your building's evacuation routes
- Avoid parking in basement carparks during heavy rain warnings
- Monitor weather forecasts during monsoon season
- Have important documents in waterproof containers
